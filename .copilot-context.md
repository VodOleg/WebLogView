# Copilot Context - WebLogView Project

**Last Updated:** December 5, 2025

## Project Overview
WebLogView is a cross-platform, web-based log viewer with real-time file monitoring. It's designed as a self-hosted alternative to BareTail that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Go 1.21+
  - gorilla/websocket for WebSocket communication
  - fsnotify for file system monitoring
- **Frontend:** Preact (with virtual scrolling)
- **Communication:** WebSocket for real-time updates + HTTP for static files

## Key Features
- Real-time log file monitoring
- WebSocket-based log streaming
- Virtual scrolling for large files
- Regex filtering support
- File rotation handling
- Auto-opens browser on startup

## Default Configuration
- Port: 8080
- Host: localhost
- Auto-browser: enabled

## Recent Changes
- **Dec 5, 2025:** Updated frontend stack from Vanilla JS to Preact in DESIGN.md
- **Dec 5, 2025:** Created main entry point at `cmd/main.go`
- **Dec 5, 2025:** Set up complete Preact frontend with Vite build system in `web/` directory
  - Created components: App, Header, LogViewer
  - Implemented WebSocket hook with auto-reconnect
  - Added virtual scrolling with react-window
  - Configured Vite with proxy to Go backend
  - Fixed IPv6/IPv4 localhost issue in Vite proxy config
- **Dec 5, 2025:** Frontend dev server running successfully on port 3000

## Current Status
- Go backend server is running in debug mode on localhost:8080
- Vite dev server running on localhost:3000 with proxy to backend
- WebSocket connection established between frontend and backend

## Next Steps / TODOs
- Test file watching functionality
- Implement file browser/selector
- Add error handling and user feedback
- Build production bundle and embed in Go binary
- Add syntax highlighting for log files (optional)
- Test on Windows and Linux
